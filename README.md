# The archive of the the rice proteogenomics database (OryzaPG-DB)

**OryzaPG database** is the rice proteogenomics database developed by  The Rice Proteogenomics Project (RPP), in the [Institute for Advanced Biosciences (IAB)](http://www.iab.keio.ac.jp/en/index.html), [Keio University](https://www.keio.ac.jp/en/). The most up to date version of the database contains the proteome and phosphoproteome of the rice undifferentiated cultured cells, the corresponding cDNA, Transcript an  d Genome sequences, the novel proteogenomics features and the updated gene models annotation.

**OryzaPG database** was online from September 2010 to May 2017. At May 2017 the OryzaPG database servers were retired. This repository provides an archive to the most recent version of OryzaPG database. The whole database can also be downloaded as a single compressed file from here[link].
